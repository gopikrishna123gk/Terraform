      In your main.tf or provider configuration file, specify the version
      provider "aws" {
        version = "2.70.0" # Use your desired version
        region  = "us-east-1"
      }

    Ensure you are using an up-to-date version of Terraform
       $ terraform version

     Verify that there are no unexpected environment variables affecting Terraform
       $ env | grep TF_
